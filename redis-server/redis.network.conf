## Minimal Redis config for LAN access
# WARNING: This exposes Redis on all network interfaces. Use a firewall or set a password (requirepass) for production.

# Listen on all interfaces on port 6379
bind 0.0.0.0

# Allow external connections (disable protected mode when binding to non-loopback)
protected-mode no

# Keep default port
port 6379

# Optional: uncomment and set a strong password to require auth from clients
# requirepass your_strong_password_here

# Keep data directory as in original config
dir ./
